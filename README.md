# Object Recognition in Images

In this project, machine learning algorithms were used to classify the object present in the image into one of the classes of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
We experimented with pixels, HOG as features, and evaluated performances with K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The optimal parameters for each were decided through GridSearch to determine the best method for classsification.
